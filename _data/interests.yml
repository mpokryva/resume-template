  <ul>
    <li>I'm a pretty decent home chef, a casual powerlifter, a hiker and runner, a guitar player and singer, and a lover of dark humor and stand-up comedy.</li>
    <li>I've recently gotten into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxTEoseZak">smoking meats</a> (I make a <i>mean</i> rack of <a href="https://jesspryles.com/recipe/smoked-bbq-beef-ribs/">beef ribs</a>), and into cooking Mexican food, so I can now make tacos from scratch, including the tortillas.</li>
    <li>Before quarantine, I was doing lots of barbell exercises and working towards doing dips with 100 lbs. Now, to burn all of the calories I eat from my sometimes-successful cooking I try to hit 10,000 steps every day and do bodyweight exercises</li>
    <li>I own a Martin X Series Custom X1-000 guitar (which I play badly), and love to sing anything from Sinatra to the Bee Gees, to Ed Sheeran.</li>
    <li>I'm a big fan of The Office and Community, and some of my favorite stand up comedians are Nate Bargatze, Gary Gulman, and Sam Morril.</li>
    <li>I'm also natively trilingual in English, Russian, and Hebrew &#58;)</li>
