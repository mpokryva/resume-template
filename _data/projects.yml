- project: End-to-End 3D Bézier Surface Reconstruction Using CNNs
  duration: July 2019 &mdash; August 2019
  description: |
    <ul>
    <li>Wrote a paper on using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to reconstruct 3D Bézier Surfaces from 2D grayscale images.</li>
    <li>Independently conducted background research, and designed and implemented neural nets using the Keras framework.</li>
    </ul>

- project: API Performance Grading System 
  duration: February 2019 &mdash; May 2019
  description: |
    <ul>
    <li>Worked in a small team as an undergraduate TA of a cloud computing course (CSE 356) to build an automated API
    performance grading system.</li>
    <li>The system was responsible for orchestrating several machines to generate load, aggregate latency results, and grade the APIs accordingly.</li>
    <li>Implemented the fuzzed load testing mechanism, which was the core logic of the system, from scratch. I also implemented server-to-server communication using RabbitMQ, and designed some MongoDB schemas.</li>
    </ul>

- project: Cloud-Based High Performance Social Networking API
  duration: March 2018 &mdash; May 2018
  description: |
    <ul>
    <li>Implemented a social networking API in Go with the functionality to authenticate, post binary and text data, follow posts
    and users, and perform complex searches on tweets.
    <li>Designed a distributed microservice architecture and automated its deployments with AWS EC2 and Ansible.
    <li>Used Nginx load balancing, a sharded MongoDB cluster, Elasticsearch, and a Memcached layer to achieve low latency query
    times under loads of hundreds of requests/s.
    </ul>
