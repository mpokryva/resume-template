intro: |
  I’m a highly-motivated engineer that thrives on solving vague, cross-cutting problems.  I’ve had experience working at large companies and extremely high-growth startups. I’ve seen the processes it takes to operate at a huge scale, and I know the growing pains, the constantly changing priorities, and the time spent on hiring it takes to eventually get there. I currently work at Confluent on our very lean API Foundations team, where I help direct the future of API design across Confluent Cloud Engineering. I’ve completed projects that have a long term effect on many engineering teams, like implementing API key-based authentication that’s widely used across Confluent’s UIs and some APIs. Previously, I worked on the equally small CLI Foundations team, where I made significant design and code contributions and went above and beyond, winning hackathon awards, and taking small projects and churning out <a href=“https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover”>high quality code</a> and <a href=“https://www.confluent.io/blog/measure-go-code-coverage-with-bincover/“>writing about it</a>.
