  This resume and blog are deployed via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI/CD pipeline</a> using a <a href="https://github.com/mpokryva/spell-check-action">GitHub Action</a> I built from scratch. The most recent version of my resume is available on <a href="https://github.com/mpokryva/resume-template">GitHub</a> (feel free to fork). The animation on the top of the resume is from <a href="https://www.pixeltrue.com/illustrations">Pixel True</a>.
