  summary: |
    <ul>
    <li>Added a mechanism to measure integration test coverage for the Confluent CLI (command line interface), a tool used
    extensively by both Confluent and its customers. On my own accord, I generalized the solution, <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover">open sourced</a> it, and wrote
    an accompanying <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/measure-go-code-coverage-with-bincover/">blog post</a>.</li>
    <li>Won the People’s Choice Award with a co-worker at Confluent’s first hackathon for developing a feature that significantly
    improved the usability of the CLI. This was the only award at the hackathon granted democratically, demonstrating the potential demand and viability of our project to go into production. I’m currently the engineering lead on the project to ship this feature.</li>
    <li>Launched an initiative to improve the quality of the CLI in which I single-handedly completed a refactoring of several thousand lines of code. This significantly improved the flexibility and robustness of the codebase and fixed a number of critical bugs. I received an “engineering superstar” award for this after being at Confluent for only four months.</li>
    <li>Implemented a new type of API key and related API key-based authentication that’s widely used in Confluent’s UI and APIs.</li>
    <li>Using Go and OpenAPI to develop a highly automated API framework that’s leveraged widely across Confluent.</li>
    <li>Integrated tools in CI pipelines to ensure backward compatibility was maintained across Confluent’s private and</li> public APIs.
    <li>Advocated for and implemented API infrastructure utilities that are used across Confluent Cloud services to provide a
    consistent public API experience.</li>
