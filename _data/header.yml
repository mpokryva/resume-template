blurb: I’m an energetic, easy-going software engineer that thrives on solving ill-defined problems. I currently work at <a href="https://confluent.io">Confluent</a> on our API Framework team where I help build the groundwork for Confluent Cloud's APIs. During my time at Confluent, I’ve also won hackathon awards, <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/bincover">open-sourced</a> a production-ready library, and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/measure-go-code-coverage-with-bincover/">blogged</a> about it.
