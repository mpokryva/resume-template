Hi, I'm Miki! I'm a senior at Stony Brook University, double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Math. I'm interested in cloud computing, machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and more. When I'm not doing CS/math, I love playing badminton, working out, and taking long walks. I also sing and (try to) play guitar.

In the last several months, I've made an effort to read more. I'm currently reading several books, including *Sapiens* by Yuval Noah Harari, *Man's Search for Meaning* by Victor Frankl, and *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann. I'll eventually post a list of all the books I've read recently, and if you have any book recommendations, I would absolutely love to hear them. Email them to me at [mpokryva@gmail.com](mailto:mpokryva@gmail.com).

I created this blog because I love to write, and every now and then I have an idea I'd like to write about, but no place to express it.

I would love to connect with you on Instagram/LinkedIn/GitHub/email!
